## Abalone Age Prediction
A Machine Learning and Data Analysis Project.

## 1.1	Overview:

Abalone is a  tremendous  cause  of  iron  and  pantothenic  acid,  is  a  beneficial  diet  reserve  and farming in many parts of the world. 100 grams of abalone profits more than 20% suggested daily 
intake of these nutrients. Abalones ought to long been a treasured food source for individuals in every part of the world  where a species is  plentiful. Agricultural of abalone began in the late 
1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China. The fiscal value of abalone is positively connected with its age. Consequently, to detect the age of abalone accurately is essential for both farmers 
and customers to decide its price. Defining the actual age of an abalone is a bit like estimating the age of a tree. Rings are moulded in the shell of the abalone as it grows, generally at the rate 
of one ring per year. In receipt of access to the rings of an abalone includes cutting the shell. After refining and staining, a lab technician examines a shell sample under a microscope and counts the rings. Because some rings are hard to make out using this technique, the researchers supposed  adding  1.5  to  the  ring  count  is  a  sensible  approximation  of  the  abalones  age.  This complex method upturns the cost and limits it popularity. Hence, researchers are interested in 
relating abalone age to variables like length, height and different kinds of weights of the animal. If a reasonably accurate model could be found to predict the age of abalone, then the farmers 
would minimize the cost and customers would get the expected goods.

## 1.2	Purpose:
Machine  learning  (ML)  algorithms  are  used  to  recognize  patterns  and  make  decisions based on empirical data. The problem of regression of a data set, that is, to determine the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series  of  other  variables  (known  as  independent  variables).  It  is  a  statistical  method  used  in finance, investing, and other disciplines. In this study, supervised learning algorithms are used to come up with a mapping function (f) that will best describe the input data (x) to conclude the output  data  (Y).  We  know  x  and  Y.  But,  we  have  to  find  the  mapping  function  (f)  that  will achieve a certain level of performance. Then, we can apply the mapping function (f) to new data to gain similar results for the age of abalone.
